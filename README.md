jQuery event tracer
===================

A bookmarklet that lets you trace the jQuery events on a page. Just drag this bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar:

<a href="javascript:(function(){window.alert("test")})();">jQuery trace</a>

Note that it assumes that jQuery is loaded on the page you are viewing.
